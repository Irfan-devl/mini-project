Creative To-Do List Application:

Project Overview:

        This project is a simple yet creative and attractive To-Do List web application. It allows users to add, complete, and remove tasks, helping them organize their daily activities. The application is built using a clean and modern design with a focus on user experience.

Features:
        
        Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks by typing into an input field and clicking the "Add" button or by pressing the "Enter" key.

Mark as Completed:
        
        A "Completed" button allows users to mark tasks as finished, applying a line-through style to the text.

Remove Tasks:
        
        An "Remove" button provides the ability to delete tasks from the list.

Local Storage:
        
        All tasks are automatically saved to the browser's local storage, so they persist even if the user closes the browser or refreshes the page.

Responsive Design:
        
        The application's layout is responsive and works well on various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

Modern UI:
        
        The interface is designed with a vibrant color palette, clear typography, and subtle animations to provide an engaging user experience.
